## Quick start

Install with [Composer](https://packagist.org/packages/chevere/workflow).

```sh
composer require chevere/workflow
```

Workflow provides the following functions at the `Chevere\Workflow` namespace:

| Function   | Purpose                              |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `workflow` | Create workflow made of named jobs   |
| `sync`     | Create synchronous blocking job      |
| `async`    | Create asynchronous non-blocking job |
| `variable` | Define workflow-level variable       |
| `response` | Define a job response reference      |

* Jobs are independent from each other, define shared variables using function `variable`
* Reference [job A response] -> [job B input] by using function `response`

## Hello, world

See the live example at [demo/hello-world.php](demo/hello-world.php)

```php
use function Chevere\Workflow\workflow;
use function Chevere\Workflow\sync;

$workflow = workflow(
    greet: sync(
        new GreetAction(),
        username: variable('username'),
    ),
);
$run = run($workflow, [
    'username' => $argv[1] ?? 'Walala',
]);
echo $run->getResponse('greet')->string();
// Hello, Walala!
```

## Full example

See the live example at [demo/image-upload.php](demo/image-upload.php)

In this example all works are defined as async but as there are dependencies between jobs the system resolves a suitable run strategy.

```php
use function Chevere\Workflow\workflow;
use function Chevere\Workflow\async;
use function Chevere\Workflow\response;
use function Chevere\Workflow\variable;

$workflow = workflow(
    thumb: async(
        new ImageResize(),
        file: variable('image'),
        fit: 'thumbnail',
    ),
    poster: async(
        new ImageResize(),
        file: variable('file'),
        fit: 'poster',
    ),
    storeThumb: async(
        new StoreFile(),
        file: response('thumb'),
        path: variable('savePath'),
    ),
    storePoster: async(
        new StoreFile(),
        file: response('poster'),
        path: variable('savePath'),
    )
);
```

The graph for the Workflow above shows that `thumb` and `poster` run async, just like `storeThumb` and `storePoster` but the storage jobs run after the first dependency level gets resolved.

```mermaid
  graph TD;
      thumb-->storeThumb;
      poster-->storePoster;
```

Use function `run` to run the Workflow:

```php
use function Chevere\Workflow\run;

$variables = [
    'image' => '/path/to/image-to-upload',
    'savePath' => '/path/to/storage/'
];
$run = run($workflow, $variables);
```

Use `$run->getResponse($job)` to retrieve a job response as a `CastArgument` object which can be used to get a typed response.

```php
$thumbFile = $run->getResponse('thumb')->string();
```

## Notes on async

Actions including any nested dependency must support serialization for being used on Workflows containing `async` jobs. If one of your Actions is not serializable, consider using `sync` for all your jobs.
